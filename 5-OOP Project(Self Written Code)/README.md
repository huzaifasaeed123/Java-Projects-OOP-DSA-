# OOP Project (Self Written Code)

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive collection of self-written code demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes implementations of basic OOP concepts such as inheritance, classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism, followed by various practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

## Features

### Basic OOP Concepts

1. **Classes and Objects**: Implementation of basic classes and creation of objects.
2. **Inheritance**: Demonstration of inheritance and its usage in code.
3. **Encapsulation**: Implementation of encapsulation to protect data.
4. **Polymorphism**: Demonstration of polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.

### Practical Examples

1. **Deck of Cards**: 
   - Implementation of a deck of cards and card-related operations.


2. **Account System**: 
   - Simulation of a simple bank account system with various account operations.


3. **Airline System**: 
   - Implementation of an airline reservation system.


4. **Car Example**: 
   - Simulation of a car with various attributes and behaviors.


5. **Grade Book Example**: 
   - Implementation of a grade book to manage student grades.


6. **School Management System**: 
   - Simulation of a school management system to handle various school operations.

7. **Sales Person Example**: 
   - Implementation of a sales tracking system for salespersons.
  
## Achievements

- **Comprehensive OOP Coverage**: Covers fundamental OOP concepts and their application.
- **Custom Logic and Design**: All code and logic are self-prepared and custom designed.
