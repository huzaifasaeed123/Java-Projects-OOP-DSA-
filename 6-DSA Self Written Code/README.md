# DSA Self Written Code

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive collection of self-written code related to various data structures and algorithms (DSA). It includes implementations and solutions to important practice questions, with a special focus on complex data structures such as Trees and Graphs. All the logic and code are self-prepared and designed to ensure a deep understanding of DSA concepts.

## Features

- **Arrays**: Implementations and operations on arrays.
- **ArrayLists**: Dynamic array implementation and related operations.
- **Assignments**: Solutions to important DSA assignments and practice questions.
- **Stacks**: Implementation of stack data structures and related algorithms.
- **Queues**: Implementation of queue data structures and related algorithms.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Binary Trees**: Implementation and operations on binary trees.
- **Binary Search Trees**: Implementation and operations on binary search trees.
- **Graphs**: Implementation of graph data structures and graph algorithms.
- **Additional DSA Concepts**: Additional concepts and advanced data structures.
