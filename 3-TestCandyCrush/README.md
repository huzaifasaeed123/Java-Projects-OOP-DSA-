# Candy Crush Game

## Project Description

Candy Crush Game is a Java-based implementation of the popular match-three puzzle game. The game logic handles complex operations such as detecting and eliminating aligned pictures, cascading effects, and scoring. When three or more identical pictures align vertically or horizontally, they are eliminated, and the pictures above them cascade down to fill the empty spaces. Each elimination scores 50 points.
